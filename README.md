Egg Timer

### Description

This is a simple egg timer application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set a timer in minutes and seconds, and then starts a countdown. When the timer reaches zero, an alarm sound is played.

### Files

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the timer application.
-   `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the appearance of the timer.
-   `javascript.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the timer functionality.
-   `img/`: This directory contains images used in the timer interface, such as an egg image, start/end button images, and a menu icon.
-   `audio/`: This directory contains the alarm sound (`rang.mp3`) that is played when the timer finishes.

### Functionality

-   Users can input the desired time in minutes and seconds.
-   The timer displays the remaining time in `MM : SS` format.
-   Clicking the start button initiates the countdown. The button changes to an "end" button.
-   Clicking the "end" button stops the timer and resets the display.
-   When the timer reaches zero, an alarm sound is played.
